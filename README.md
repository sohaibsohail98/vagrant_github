```Introduction to the Vagrant with Virtualbox```

In this repository, you should see my VM and Vagrant progress. This includes
commands and work I've completed on Vagrant. 

We also installed Nginx Module - which initialises the web server functionality
and create a private IP to access the Nginx server on the web.

```What we have done so far:```

- Updated our vagrant environment

- Created new directories within our Vagrant system 

- Created new files within directories

- Deleted files within directories

- Changed permissions on vagrant file, EG: user or the admin

- Install packages such as Nginx within the Vagrant system - which will install the web server functionality

- Edited Vagrantfile script to make sure it connects the IP address to the web address.

- Checked the status of the package Nginx within our Vagrant system
